Possessive pronouns
If something belongs to you, you’ll need to use a possessive pronoun. Possessive pronouns (Possessivpronomen) are pronouns that show that something belongs to someone.

In English, we have two forms: the possessive adjective and the possessive pronoun. You can see the difference in the table below:

Possessive Adjective	Possessive Pronoun
my	mine
your	yours
his, her, its	his, her, its
our	ours
your	yours
their	theirs
Example:

That’s my book. (Possessive adjective)
The book is mine. (Possessive pronoun)

As you can see, a possessive adjective comes before the noun, while possessive pronouns are used after the noun.
